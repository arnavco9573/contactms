<h1>Contact Management System with Redux CRUD Operations, Local Storage, Maps, and Charts</h1>
Welcome to the Contact Management System project! This is a web application built using React and Redux that allows you to manage contacts, perform CRUD operations, store data in local storage, and visualize COVID-19 statistics on a map and charts.

Features
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing contacts using Redux.
Data is persisted using local storage to ensure your contacts are saved even after closing the application.
Interactive map powered by React Leaflet that displays COVID-19 statistics for different countries.
Charts that visualize COVID-19 data including active, recovered, and death cases for selected countries.
Easy navigation through a responsive navbar.
